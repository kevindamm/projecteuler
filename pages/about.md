## Who is the audience?

Honestly, myself and maybe search engines looking to confirm that I'm an expert
or authority on certain topics.  But really, when I'm writing each blog post and
the code/comments in the repo, I'm thinking of somebody who has some programming
experience, enough to be effective and interested in learning more.  Somebody
who likes to dig deeper into a topic while also being interested in a broad
range of topics.  Somebody interested in how the same problem might be viewed
from different directions.


## Why these problems?  Why not something practical?

Working on a well-defined goal with small scope is a good distraction, and a 
great vehicle for practicing new languages, techniques and environments.  The
more practical problems are less well defined, less finite and less relatable.
I do have a few other projects, though, some much more practical than this.

I've honed my Python, C++, Java and Go with these puzzles, and tested the
limits of type systems, concurrency management, bit manipulation and symbol
transformations in each of these problems.  The beauty of most of these problems
is that they don't prescribe a certain method of doing things, they only declare
the constraints that must be met.  It has made learning Prolog with ProjectEuler
quite interesting, too.

I've also sometimes let my laptop run for multiple days on the same problem
thinking that maybe it was just over the horizon, and knowing that I needed to
stop and approach it a different way.  Only once did a program that took longer
than 30 minutes ever finish when I waited more than a day.


## Why not leetcode, interview questions, or advent of code *or other*?

## Is ProjectEuler.net okay with you giving away the answers?

They do make a special exception for the first 100 problems.  In general, I
agree with them that the real enjoyment comes from solving these problems
yourself.  I try to provide more than just delivering answers in these blog
posts, aiming to dig deeper than the superficial answer and provide references
to related topics and related problems.

I also hope that the visualizations provide some legibility for those who are
not as comfortable with mathematical formulae.  I also hope that those who
are more comfortable with the math still learn something interesting from the
surrounding discussion.
