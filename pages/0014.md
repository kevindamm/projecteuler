# PE 0014: {{ $frontmatter.title }}

<pe100-problem n="14">

The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>$n \to n/2$ ($n$ is even)</li>
  <li>$n \to 3n + 1$ ($n$ is odd)</li>
</ul>

Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence:
$$13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1.$$

It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$)
contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem),
it is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.

Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?

<p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
