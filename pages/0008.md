The four adjacent digits in the following $1000$-digit number that have the
greatest product are $9 \times 9 \times 8 \times 9 = 5832$.

<<< @/data/0008_digits.txt [digits]

Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the $1000$-digit number that have the
greatest product. What is the value of this product?

## Exercises

1. Suppose the product of adjacent digits is too large to compute reasonably,
either the window is very large, bigint too slow or the multiplication operator
a more involved operation.  Perform the search based on the count of digits
(i.e., sorting on number of nines, tie-breaking on lower values.)

2. Consider the digits to represent cards, what is the sequence of five that
has the best value in terms of poker hands?  High straights beat full house
beat two pairs, etc. following the probability of each being dealt.

3. For each pair of thirteen-digit sequences, which have the smallest difference
between them?  Which have the smallest edit distance?
