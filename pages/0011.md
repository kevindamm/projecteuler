<pe100-problem n="11">

In the $20 \times 20$ grid below, four numbers along a horizontal, vertical or
diagonal line can be grouped and their product calculated.

<<< @/data/0011_grid.txt [number grid]

For example, the product of numbers
$26 \times 63 \times 78 \times 14 = 1788696$.

What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction
(up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the $20 \times 20$ grid?
