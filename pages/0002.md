# PE 0002: {{ $frontmatter.title }}

<pe100-problem n="2">

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
two terms.  By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:

$$ 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots $$

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Step-by-Step

Since this is another simple one, we'll start with another simple solution.

<!-- TODO number counting component -->


## Odds and Evens

The first thing to notice is that only every third element of the sequence will
be even.  This is because of the (ODD ODD EVEN)-repeating pattern which will
always appear in recurrent sums like this:

<table><tbody><tr>
<td>odd</td><td>odd</td><td>even</td><td>odd</td><td>odd</td><td>even</td><td>odd</td><td>odd</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
