<pe100-problem n="9">

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three numbers
  $a, b, c \in \mathbb N$,
  $a \lt b \lt c$ and

$$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$

For example, $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2$.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which $a + b + c = 1000$.

Find the product $abc$.

## Brute Force Search

We are given two constraints to find three variables but we know the search
space is bounded and reasonably small.  We're searching for two numbers (a, b)
which together must sum less than 1000 because a third must add with them to
1000 and we know all three numbers are greater than zero.

Since we can derive $c$ from the $a, b$ pair, we're really looking at
$1000 \times 1000$ (at most), or less than one million possibilities.
Really not that much, so it's reasonable to use brute-force search:

```python
for a in range(2, number):
  for b in range(a+1, number):
    c = number - a - b
    c2 = a**2 + b**2
    if c**2 == c2:
      PythagoreanTriplet(a, b, c)
```

We can avoid any floating-point math by comparing $c^2$ instead of taking the
root of one to compare them as $c$.  This avoids having to check for "equal
within a tolerance".  We can also start the $b$ value at one more than $a$
because a Pythagorean triplet has unique values by definition (also, if $a = b$
then we know $c$ cannot be in $\mathbb N$, do you see why?).
