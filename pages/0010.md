## Generating Primes

See the discussion on primes [TODO: link](#) for generating the sequence of
prime integers.  There really aren't any tricks here that I'm aware of other
than approximating it with the totient function (ok, I can write a bit about
that).  We could sum on our way up while building the sieve (actually, was
thinking of adding some callbacks into the prime utilities in golang).


## Exercises

1. What is the largest prime that can fit into a 64-bit integer?

2. What is the largest sum of primes that can fit into a 64-bit integer?

3. What are the trade-offs when deciding between big-integer or int64/uint64
for prime factorization and prime sequence generation?
