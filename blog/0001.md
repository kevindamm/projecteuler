# 0001: Multiples of 3 or 5

[[toc]]

## Problem Description

If we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$,
we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$.

Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.


## Simple Approach

This one doesn't need much consideration &mdash; only 1000 values have to be
inspected and it's a simple property, integer divisibility, something that we
can check with the _modulus operator_ (`%`) easily.

```go
sum := 0
for i := range N {
  if i%5 == 0 || i%3 == 0 {
    sum += i
  }
}
```

A direct and brute-force approach like this will still complete in less than a
second, even on a small device.

Under a minute, really, even if you include the time for typing the code out.


## Selection Approach

That naÃ¯ve solution inspects all natural values below $n$, even though we know
that about half of them are not divisible by $3$ nor by $5$. 

To save having to div/mod each of these excluded values, we can count upwards
in increments of these numbers, making sure to only count the multiples of three
or five.

```python
def gen_divisors(n: int) -> Iterator[int]:
  """Generate all integers between 1..n that are divisible by either 3 or 5."""
  for i3 in range(3,n,3):
    yield i3

  for i5 in range(5,n,15):
    # skip each third multiple of 5,
    yield i5
    i5 += 5
    if i5 < n:
      # ...careful not to exceed n.
      yield i5

sum(gen_divisors(1000))
```

This skips a lot of unnecessary computation by only looking at the numbers that
we know will be included in the sum.  You could simplify the second loop to look
at every five-multiple and skip when the number also divides $3$, but we know in
advance that will always be the third one (the one divisible by $15$).

The order that these numbers are added together is not strictly increasing, but
that does not affect the final result.


## Constant-time Approach

As $n$ gets bigger, the time spent iterating through the multiples of three and
five increases as well.  Do we have to look at every multiple, even if we're
only examining known multiples?

Looking closer at the previous solution will reveal a pattern that emerges:

<div class="numbergrid" data-id="sieve100"></div>

The components of the above are the arithmetic sum (in steps of 15):

$$ C * \sum_{i=0}^k i = {105 * k(k - 1) \over 2} $$

where C is 15 (the step size of each row) times 7 (the count of elements
included in each row).

<div class="numbergrid" data-id="remainder100"></div>

There are also the offset values within each row.  That is, after subtracting
the above summation out of each row, all the rows have the same set of values:

$$ k * (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12)  $$

There may be a few values remaining between $15*k$ and $n$, we can sum those up
in a couple of small for loops, adding them to the main result.  Or, since we
know the row size consists of non-shared multiples of $3$ and $5$, we can use
some number theory to arrive at the result without even having to loop through
the numbers in the remainder:

```go
k := n / 15 // integer division
rowcount := (5 /*3s*/ + 3 /*5s*/ - 1 /*common*/)
rowsum := (0 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12)

sum := (rowcount * 15 * k * (k - 1) / 2)
sum += k * rowsum

// Add remaining multiples of 3 and 5 (excluding n).
delta := n - 1 - k*15
div3, div5 := delta/3, delta/5
sum += k * 15 * (div3 + div5 + 1)
sum += div3 * (div3 + 1) * 3 / 2
sum += div5 * (div5 + 1) * 5 / 2
```

To understand the last three lines, it helps to think of the last (partial) row
as its own arithmetic series ($\sum i$) for the threes and fives separately,
offset by the $k$th row as with all of the previous rows.  The `div3` and `div5`
are the limits on these composite series, arrived at by the size of the gap
between $n$ and the last $k*15$ value.


## Generalized Approach

We could further generalize this to any pair of numbers $a$ and $b$, finding the
sum of their multiples that are less than $n$.  Rather than knowing in advance
to loop every 15, we need to find the
[Least Common Multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple)
of the pair and use that as our row size.  We can compute it with Euclid's
algorithm (which actually determines the greatest common divisor, which we can
easily derive the LCM from).

```ts
function SumOfPairsLessThan(a: number, b: number, n: number): number {
  const width = lcm(a, b);
  const k = Math.floor(n / width);
  const diva = width / a;
  const divb = width / b;

  const rowcount = diva + divb - 1;
  const rowsum = (diva * (diva + 1) * a + divb * (divb + 1) * b) / 2;

  var sum = rowcount * width * k * (k - 1) / 2;
  sum += k * rowsum;

  const delta = n - 1 - k*width;
  const rema = delta / a;
  const remb = delta / b;
  sum += k * width * (rema + remb + 1);
  sum += rema * (rema + 1) * a / 2;
  sum += remb * (remb + 1) * b / 2;

  return sum
}

function lcm(a: number, b: number): number {
  // Javascript and floating-point error, let's round to be sure, though it's
  // only needed when a*b is many orders of magnitude larger than gcd(a, b).
  return Math.round((a * b) / gcd(a, b));
}

function gcd(a: number, b: number): number {
  if (b === 0) {
    return a;
  }
  return gcd(b, a % b);
}
```


## Exercises

1. Where is the break-even point, i.e. when the constant-time approach goes from
   being worse than the linear-time solution to being better?  This may vary by 
   platform based on the cost of a div/mod and chosen values for $m, k$ and $n$.

   Benchmark both solutions on your chosen platform and measure for yourself.

   An example of benchmarking these solutions is included in the 
   [golang solution on GitHub](
    https://github.com/kevindamm/projecteuler/tree/main/golang/p001).


2. In the constant-time solution there is an expression
   `rowcount * 15 * k * (k - 1) / 2`.  How do we know that this division by $2$
   will not give us a $0.5$ remainder that gets truncated off?


3. Further generalize the solution to any three divisors.  In doing so, you
   should be able to see a straightforward approach for any $k$ divisors.


4. What is the computational complexity of finding this sum (with respect to
   $n$) for any $k$ divisors?  If $k$ is not fixed?  If $k$ is larger than $n$?
