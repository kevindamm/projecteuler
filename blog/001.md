## Problem Description

If we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$.

Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.


## Simple Approach

This one doesn't need much consideration &mdash; only 1000 values need to be inspected and it's a simple property, integer divisibility.

A direct and brute-force approach will still solve it in a matter of seconds (under a minute even if you include the time to type the code out).

```go
sum := 0
for i := range N {
  if i%5 == 0 || i%3 == 0 {
    sum += i
  }
}
```
