[Project Euler page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=11)


## Problem Description

In the $20 \times 20$ grid below, four numbers along a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line can be grouped and their product calculated.

<<< @/data/0011_grid.txt [number grid]


For example, the product of numbers $26 \times 63 \times 78 \times 14 = 1788696$.

What is the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) in the $20 \times 20$ grid?
