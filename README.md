Solutions and commentary on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)
puzzles.

This includes some blog posts written in Markdown and Vue3 (using Vitepress) and
example programs written in Go, Python, TypeScript and GEL (Goal Expression
Language).  I've used this collection of math puzzles for practice and mastery
of new programming languages and programming techniques.  This time, I'm using
it to hone my Typescript/Vue3 skills and I also thought it would be a good way
to share my expertise on the topics touched on in the puzzles themselves.
